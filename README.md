# Fruits Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
This project is an introduction to deep learning via CNN. The objective is to build and optimise a model
to classify fruit images using Tensorflow and Keras. Image augmentation was one aspect to optimise the model. 
Individual performance of different architectures were tracked using metrics such as accuracy, validation loss
and early stopping.
